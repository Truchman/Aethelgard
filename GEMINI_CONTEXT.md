# Aethelgard Project Context

This project contains the comprehensive game design documentation for **Aethelgard**. The core of the documentation resides in the `Plan/` directory and is structured as a network of interlinked Markdown files.

## Key Documents & Entry Points

To quickly get up to speed, start with these key files:

- **[Master Index (README)](./Plan/README.md)**: The primary entry point for understanding the project structure. **Always start here** to navigate to all other documents.

- **[Art Style Guide](./Plan/Game/Design/StyleGuide.md)**: Defines the core visual aesthetic (2D isometric pixel art). This is essential for any asset generation tasks.

- **[Core Gameplay Loop (Village Management)](./Plan/Game/Systems/VillageManagement.md)**: Describes the central city-builder and character management mechanics, which are the heart of the game.

- **[Available Scripts](./scripts/README.md)**: Details on utility scripts like asset generation (`generate_png_asset.py`) and image downscaling (`downscale_image.py`).

## How to Work with This Project

The documentation is designed to be explored. To understand any specific concept (e.g., how the Forge works), you must **navigate by reading the files and following the Markdown links** within them. This will require using file system tools to read and move between documents. Do not assume concepts; find the relevant document and read it.
