# Aethelgard Project Context

## Structure
All design documents are located within the `Plan/` directory, which is organized into `Game/Design`, `Game/Entities`, and `Game/Systems`. The primary entry point for understanding the project is `Plan/README.md`.

## Navigation
The documentation is a network of interlinked Markdown (`.md`) files. To understand any specific concept, you must navigate by reading the files and following the Markdown links within them. This will require using file system tools to read and move between documents.

## Tools
The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts, including `generate_png_asset.py` for creating image assets using Vertex AI, and `downscale_image.py` for image manipulation.
