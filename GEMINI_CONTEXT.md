# Gemini Context for Aethelgard Asset Generation

This document outlines the context and decisions made during the process of generating pixel art sprites for the Aethelgard game assets.

## Goal
The primary goal was to generate colorful pixel art sprites for various game entities, suitable for a 2D isometric view.

## Tools Utilized
- `generate_png_asset.py`: A custom Python script leveraging Vertex AI's Image Generation Model for initial image creation.
- `downscale_image.py`: A custom Python script using the Pillow library for post-processing, specifically to downscale generated images to a target resolution and ensure a pixel art aesthetic.

## Key Decisions and Workflow

1.  **Reference Image:** `Untitled.jpg` was used as a reference image to guide the style of the generated pixel art.

2.  **Prompt Engineering for Pixel Art:**
    -   Initial attempts with simpler prompts did not yield satisfactory pixel art results.
    -   The prompt was refined to: "low resolution 8-bit colorful pixel art of a [asset_name], retro game style, blocky, limited color palette, transparent background". This detailed prompt aimed to guide the generative AI model more effectively towards the desired aesthetic.

3.  **Resolution Control via Post-processing:**
    -   The Vertex AI Image Generation Model's `generate_images` method does not allow direct control over very low resolutions suitable for pixel art (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64). It primarily supports "1K" (1024x1024) or "2K" resolutions.
    -   To achieve the desired low-resolution pixel art, a two-step process was implemented:
        1.  Generate the image using `generate_png_asset.py` at its default resolution (typically 1K).
        2.  Downscale the generated image to a target resolution (e.g., 64x64 pixels) using `downscale_image.py` with nearest-neighbor interpolation to preserve the blocky pixel art look.

4.  **Transparent Background:** The prompt was updated to include "transparent background" to encourage the model to generate sprites on a blank or transparent canvas. Further post-processing might be required if the model does not consistently produce true transparency.

5.  **Asset Sizing based on Game Context:**
    -   The `GameDesign/Technical/ArchitectureAndUI.md` file was reviewed for specific asset sizing guidelines.
    -   No explicit pixel dimensions for game assets were found in the provided documentation.
    -   Therefore, a default target resolution of 64x64 pixels was chosen for downscaling, based on user feedback regarding "low resolution" and satisfactory pixel art style. This can be adjusted if specific game requirements are later provided.

6.  **Whisk API Exploration:**
    -   An attempt was made to explore the possibility of using the "Whisk" generative AI tool (from Google Labs) via an API.
    -   No public API for the Google Labs AI Experiment "Whisk" was found that could be directly integrated into this workflow.

## Current Status
-   `Building.png` has been re-generated with the improved prompt, transparent background attempt, and downscaled to 64x64.
-   User review is pending for `Building.png` to confirm satisfaction with the transparent background and overall style before proceeding with other assets.
