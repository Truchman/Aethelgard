# System: Progression

## Description
The game features a progression system based on "tiers" rather than traditional levels and experience. Each tier represents a major advancement for a character or the entire camp, unlocking new roles, buildings, or permanent stat boosts.

## Associated Concepts
- **Energy Accumulation**: Progression is tied to the accumulation of a special **Energy** [resource](../Entities/Resource.md). This energy is accumulated passively based on the level of associated [buildings](../Entities/Building.md).
- **Tier Advancement**: Reaching a specific energy threshold unlocks the next tier of advancements.
- **Active Acceleration**: Players can actively speed up energy accumulation by:
  - Consuming alchemy "pills" created via the [Crafting](./Crafting.md) system.
  - Assigning a [character](../Entities/Character.md) to meditate in an **Energy Concentration Room**.
