# Alchemy and Smithing: Unique and Procedural Crafting

## Description
This document outlines the unique and procedural crafting systems in Aethelgard.

## Associated Concepts
- **Alchemy**: The alchemy system is similar to "modern chemistry." An "active principle" corresponds to a chemical molecule created by combining "base compounds" or "base atoms." The goal is to allow the creation of a "near-infinite amount of plants" with varied properties.
- **Smithing**: Smithing uses "unique and procedural resources" to create [equipment](../../Game/Crafting/Entities/Equipment.md) whose stats and special skills are generated based on the [ingredients](../../Game/Entities/Ingredient.md). For example, a "fire iron mineral" could always grant a fire damage attribute, but the intensity of this effect and the attached special skill would vary depending on the quality of the other materials used.
- **Exploration Driver**: These crafting systems are the main driver of the [exploration system](../../Game/Systems/Exploration.md), as the quest for rare [resources](../../Game/Entities/Resource.md) found in distant [territories](../../Game/Entities/Territory.md) is the central motivation that pushes the player to travel.
