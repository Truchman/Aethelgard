# Gameplay: Day-Night Cycle

## Description
The game features a full day-night cycle that influences gameplay and the behavior of [Characters](../Entities/Character.md).

## Cycle Phases
- **Day (Work Phase)**:
  - Characters are active, performing their assigned roles.
  - Production buildings are operational.
  - Expeditions can be launched.
- **Night (Rest Phase)**:
  - Characters return to their designated housing to rest, restoring **Stamina**.
  - Most production ceases (unless the building is upgraded for nocturnal operation).
  - Certain magical [Ingredients](../Entities/Ingredient.md), like the **Moonpetal Flower**, only spawn at night.
  - Certain nocturnal events can occur.
