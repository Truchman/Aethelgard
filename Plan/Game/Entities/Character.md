# Entity: Character

## Description
Characters are the inhabitants of the player's [flying island](./Island.md). While the player doesn't control them directly like an RPG, they are managed by assigning roles, scheduling tasks, and tending to their needs. Each character is unique, with distinct traits and skills.
